# Jukebox

A jukebox implemented in object pascal (delphi) that has the following functions:

 - Read a folder that contains other folders, each with an MP3 album.
 - Each folder contains the audio files and a cover.jpg file, which is used as the album cover.
 - The name of the song must be displayed in the list, without the full path.
 - When closing the app, if a song is playing it should come back at the same time
 that stopped and the playlist the same.
 - Touch Screen Model. 
 
# Prerequisites
- You just need to download or have the songs and a cover for that album and store it in the program folder.
